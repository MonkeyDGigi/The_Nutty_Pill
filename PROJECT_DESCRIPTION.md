The Nutty Pill is an open-source Bitcoin education platform that gamifies learning through a reward-based system. Built on the Cashu.me ecash wallet infrastructure, it enables orange pillers to help their friends and family learn about Bitcoin while earning satoshis (sats) as they progress.

**Key Features:**
- 84 comprehensive Bitcoin lessons across 4 topics: Bitcoin History (21 lessons), The Tech (21 lessons), 21M/∞ Economics (21 lessons), and Stay Sovereign Self-Custody (21 lessons)
- Reward system where learners unlock sats by completing lessons with 100% scores
- Admin dashboard for setting up reward pools and managing locked sats
- Multiple visual themes including Neon Cyberpunk and Kawaii
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support for native-like mobile experience
- Local progress tracking (privacy-focused, no server-side tracking)

**How It Works:**
Orange pillers set up The Nutty Pill on a learner's device, create a wallet, and lock sats in a reward pool. Learners complete interactive lessons with questions, and unlock sats as they demonstrate understanding. All progress is stored locally on the device, ensuring privacy. The admin can access the wallet via seed phrase on cashu.me if needed for recovery or unlocking sats.

**Technology:**
Built with Vue.js and Quasar Framework, using the Cashu ecash protocol for Bitcoin transactions. Fully client-side with no backend required - all wallet operations happen locally in the browser.
